A big thanks for jjoe64 and his GraphView-Demos open-source project which helped me a lot to finalize my project.

To use eHealth_V2 project, please work with faculty_project branch

eHealth_V2 is a project I made with my team for University purpose. We used eHealth Sensor platform (Cooking Hacks) to measure some values like ECG, temperature, etc. and jjoe64's library to show those values as a graph.

The values are written in a format we used in arduino console (you can use which ever style you like) and sent through bluetooth sensor to our android app. In class ParseData, we read that data and parse it in the format we like.

To use this app, you need to connect eHealth sensors correctly so you can read those values in this android app.


PS We don't guarantee that this project is 100% working, because a lot of changes were made in the past few months.
